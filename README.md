# Module replacements website

This website is a simple visualization of the data provided by the [e18e](https://e18e.dev) community in the [module-replacements](https://github.com/es-tooling/module-replacements) repository

## Why?

I wanted a quick way to find module replacements and to be able to make a link that others can follow.
